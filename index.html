            <p>I have recently made a huge career change due to my body not being able to handle strenous manual labor jobs anymore. I am very nervous but extremely exicted to learn about coding. I believe that the technology-based jobs will be the way of the future</p>

            <h1>Title D</h1>
            <strong><small></small></strong>
            <p> I attended Stephen f. Austin State University in Nacogdoches Tx. I was apart of the football team. I enjoy  I graduated with a Bachelors in Kinesology/History.
             I spent the next two years after graduating working in the oil field. Was laid off due to the oil crash back in 2016.
            After taking a couple months to evaulate my options. I decided to call a friend of mine who said He could get me hired on at the beer company he worked at. So I packed up all my stuff and moved to Austin Tx. I worked as a delviery assistant for six months, I got my Cdl so I became a delviery driver for the bar and resturants side. After two and half years of delivering around Austin. I took a team lead positon to work special events for one year. A delivery manager positon came open on the bars and resturants side and I got the job. Sadly my body could not hold up to the physical demands of the job. So now I am excited to begin my career in tech!!
